Objectives:
-----------

Meetup 1: class, module, instance variables, attribute accessors
          
  notes: class includes module; the instance variables of the class
         are visible by the module methods.

Meetup 2: class inheritance, module included, module not included.
          
  notes: 
  a) we show 2 different ways to initialize instance variables, with "@name"  
     (see file person1.rb) and with "self.name" using the accessor methods 
     (see file person2.rb)
 
  b) we have logic, in file user_of_person2.rb, of the class Person2 defined
     in its own separate file; this is done using 'require'.
